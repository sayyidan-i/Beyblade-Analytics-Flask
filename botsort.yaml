# Ultralytics YOLO ðŸš€, AGPL-3.0 license
# Optimized YOLO tracker settings for BoT-SORT tracker for fast-moving Beyblades

tracker_type: botsort  # ['botsort', 'bytetrack'], BoT-SORT is preferred for more complex motion
track_high_thresh: 0.1  # Lowered threshold for first association to better handle rapid movements
track_low_thresh: 0.05  # Lowered second association threshold to track Beyblades even when they slow down or move erratically
new_track_thresh: 0.5  # A slightly relaxed threshold to initialize new tracks in case of fast object appearances
track_buffer: 20  # Shorter buffer to ensure faster removal and re-association of Beyblade tracks
match_thresh: 0.5  # A slightly reduced matching threshold to allow for quicker updates when Beyblades move fast
fuse_score: True  # Fuse confidence scores with IOU for robust tracking under fast motion

# BoT-SORT settings
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow  # Keep sparseOptFlow for handling fast and erratic motion of Beyblades
proximity_thresh: 0.8  # Slightly increase the proximity threshold to capture fast-moving objects in close proximity
appearance_thresh: 0.1  # Slightly lowered to balance re-identification with fast-moving objects
with_reid: True

# Additional considerations for small objects and fast motion
min_box_area: 5  # Set to a smaller box area since Beyblades can be small in the video frame
max_age: 15  # Max age to keep tracks alive for fast re-identification after temporary occlusions
